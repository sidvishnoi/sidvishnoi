I'm Sid, a passionate software engineer and full-stack web developer with a knack for front-end development.

I love working with TypeScript, CSS and C++ and have a growing interest in Rust. I'm a quick learner and adept at picking up new languages and tools.

I bring extensive experience in web-related technologies, including in-depth knowledge of ECMAScript, CSS, HTML, and HTTP. I also have experience working with common frameworks such as Svelte and React. I'm adept at learning new languages and technologies. I'm also very comfortable with Git, GitHub, open-source workflows, code review, test-driven development, and tooling in general.

For the last 2.5+ years, I've been working remotely at [Monetized.link](https://www.monetized.link) (and [Keyosk.co](https://www.keyosk.co)) as a full-stack developer. As a founding engineer, I spearheaded the development of a no-code paywall platform built with SvelteKit/TailwindCSS/TypeScript, Firebase, ElasticSearch and Google Cloud.
I was responsible for end-to-end development of the product, ensuring a seamless user journey for complex functionalities -- multi-tenant architecture, analytics, Stripe integration, and Web3 (Ethereum) protocols.
This project not only challenged me technically, but also allowed me to demonstrate my ability to deliver complex functionalities while ensuring a seamless user journey.

**Some history:** I've been coding since nearly 2009 and decided to take on software development professionally in 2016.
In 2018, I was a [Google Summer of Code scholar for Mozilla](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2018-Summary). Since then, I've continued to be an [active contributor](https://github.com/sidvishnoi) in the open-source community, where I focused on bringing new tools and services [widely used at the W3C](https://github.com/w3c/spec-prod/). I presented my W3C tooling-related work at W3C TPAC 2019 in Fukuoka, Japan. In 2020, I was awarded the Mozilla Open Source Support ([MOSS](https://github.com/mozilla/MOSS-Directory/blob/f7261fa383cc4bcef885624e8ac73f2ab2cf32ec/Foundational_Technology.md)) award to work on the same project.
Later, I was selected as the first technical scholar by [Grant for the Web](https://community.interledger.org/grantfortheweb/introducing-our-first-technical-scholar-sid-vishnoi-1pjm), where I [prototyped](https://community.interledger.org/wmfirefox/bringing-web-monetization-to-the-web-platform-grant-report-2-2fff) WebMonetization API in Firefox.

**Some normal human behavior:** When I'm not diving into code, you'll find me appreciating nature's beauty – watching sunsets, gazing at the clouds, or nurturing my terrace garden – far from a screen.

PS: You may see me referred to as **Sudhanshu Vishnoi** in some places – that's my legal name!
