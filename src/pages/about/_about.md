I'm Sid, a passionate software engineer and full-stack web developer with a knack for front-end development. Fueled by a passion for technology, I embarked on my self-taught developer journey 12 years <!-- NOTE: update number of years since 2008 every year; count sounds better than actual year here --> ago, and I haven't stopped learning since.

I leverage my expertise in modern web development principles to build performant and interactive web applications, with a commitment to creating accessible user experiences.

I'm a quick learner with a proficiency in various programming languages and frameworks, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies.

For the past 2.5+ years, I've been a founding engineer at [Monetized.link] (and [Keyosk.co]), leading the full-stack development of a no-code paywall platform.
I owned the entire development lifecycle, including designing complex features like multi-tenant architecture, providing insights to creators and admins, and integrating Stripe & Web3 (Ethereum) protocols. Built with SvelteKit/TailwindCSS/TypeScript for a smooth user experience, Firebase for backend power, ElasticSearch and Redis for fast search, and Google Cloud for a scalable foundation.
Besides pushing my technical boundaries, this project allowed me to showcase my ability to deliver intricate functionalities that provide a pleasant user experience.

**Some history:** I've been coding since nearly 2009 and decided to take on software development professionally in 2016.
In 2018, I was a [Google Summer of Code scholar for Mozilla][gsoc]. Since then, I've continued to be an active contributor in the open-source community, where I focused on bringing new tools and services [widely used at the W3C][spec-prod]. I presented my W3C tooling-related work at W3C TPAC 2019 in Fukuoka, Japan. In 2020, I was awarded the Mozilla Open Source Support ([MOSS]) award to work on the same project.
Later, I was selected as the first technical scholar by [Grant for the Web][gftw], where I [prototyped][gftw-firefox] WebMonetization API in Firefox.

**Some normal human behavior:** To balance out my work in software development, I find it refreshing to unplug and connect with nature through activities like hiking, stargazing, or tending to my rooftop garden.

PS: You may see me referred to as **Sudhanshu Vishnoi** in some places â€“ that's my legal name!
